### FAQ ###

    CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:34 (FIND_PACKAGE):
      By not providing "FindPCL.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
      asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "PCL", but
      CMake did not find one.
      Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PCL" (requested
      version 1.7) with any of the following names:
        PCLConfig.cmake
        pcl-config.cmake
      Add the installation prefix of "PCL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "PCL_DIR"
      to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "PCL" provides a
      separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
    -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
